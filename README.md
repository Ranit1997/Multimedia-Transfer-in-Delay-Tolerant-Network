This is a mini project of 4th semester in CST Department IIEST Shibpur. Here, I have worked with the Java based ONE Simulator to simulate
the Delay Tolerant Network Scenario. I have used OpenCV Java to simulate multimedia (image data) transfer between the nodes of the network
in my local machine. The entire scenario can be observed in src/Game folder.
